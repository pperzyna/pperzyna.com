This post will be really short. Iâ€™ve marked a few points why using the toolkit is a brilliant idea.

- **Time Savings** - It allows you to bootstrap your project in a minute; consume all functions and methods that already someone wrote for you.
- **Scale Ability** - Most frameworks have been tested by many, so is more likely to scale better than something you come up with alone
- **Robustness** - It is similar to scaling, more brains can pop up with an efficient way of doing it.
- **Security** - It is easier to patch all vulnerabilities, if you have common ground with available solutions, that are prepared by the community.
- **Integrity** - Sometimes, a framework can give you a possibility to integrate other services in an easy way, because someone already needs it.
