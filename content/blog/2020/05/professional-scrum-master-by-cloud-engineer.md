Recently, I decided to review and organize my knowledge about Scrum - agile framework to manage projects. I marked 6 points that helped me prepare and pass PSM 1.

<!--more-->

I really like the Scrum concept, because it follows with the Continuous Improvement approach which is one of my personal values. This can be used in business, but also by people as an ongoing effort to be better each day.

Scrum has pros and cons, each is well described on the Scrum website, with a good explanation of [what Scrum is](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum).

> Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

I’ve been working as a cloud engineer in an agile environment for quite a long time. I have a lot of practical experience with all agile processes and terms such as **Sprint Planning**, **Sprint Retrospective**, **Sprint Review**, and **Sprint** itself and I know it like the back of my hand. I am also a goal-oriented person and it is easier for me to find motivation if I have a target. So, I set myself up to pass the **Professional Scrum Master** (PSM 1) exam in a week.

Here is my way:

1. I read [The Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/index.html) and created a mind map.
2. I did an [Open Assessment](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments) for Scrum, Developer, and Product Owner.
3. I went over [the suggested readings](https://www.scrum.org/resources/suggested-reading-professional-scrum-master).
4. I’ve played with quizzes from [mlapshin.com](https://mlapshin.com) and [volkerdon.com](https://www.volkerdon.com/).
5. I’ve constantly adjusted a mind map with missing pieces.
6. I took and passed the exam!

I passed with a score of 91%, but it was not easy. Make sure that you feel well prepared and there are no gaps in your theoretical knowledge.

## Mind Map

Usually, I draw mind maps on paper, but this time I wanted to try something new. I tried for the first time an online tool called [Coggle](https://coggle.it/recommend/5e9ad8411aab64689c0e89d5) and I really enjoyed it. I was able to move and reorganize my map all the time. I think it looks great but check on your own.
