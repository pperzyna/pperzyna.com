Policy is important to manage, and there are a few options to do this. One option is to write a wiki page, another is to use policy as code with Open Policy Agent, and a third option is to use monitoring and alerting to manually hunt down and fix problems.

Are you looking for a way to manage policies in your organization? If so, you’re not alone. Many organizations struggle with how to effectively manage policies, especially when it comes to security. The traditional approach of writing a wiki page and expecting people to read and follow it is often ineffective. That’s why many organizations are turning to policy as code and automated policy enforcement. Policy as code is a way of writing policies in a language that computers can understand and interpret. This allows the system to automatically enforce the policies, without relying on people to read and follow a wiki page. This is especially useful for security policies, such as not running processes as root on servers or containers, or not allowing certain URLs to be accessed. In addition to policy as code, there are other options for managing policies. For example, you could use monitoring and alerting to detect policy violations and then manually hunt down and fix the problems. Another option is to use Open Policy Agent (OPA), which is a major tool for policy enforcement. OPA is a powerful tool that allows you to define policies as code and then interpret and enforce them. No matter which approach you choose, it’s important to have a system in place to manage
