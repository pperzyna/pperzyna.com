Pini Reznik has been working in software configuration management for over 20 years, starting in Israel at Checkpoint and then moving to Holland to join TomTom. After facing challenges in his job, he decided to leave and join his later co-founder Jamie, which eventually led to the creation of Container Solutions. With the help of TreeFork, they were able to bootstrap the company and focus on cloud native solutions.
